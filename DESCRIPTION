Description: Methods for inference about relationships between contributors to a DNA mixture and 
  other individuals of known genotype: a basic example would be testing whether a contributor to 
  a mixture is the father of a child of known genotype. The package implements the methods introduced in 
  Green, P. J. and Mortera, J. (2017) <doi:10.1016/j.fsigen.2017.02.001> and 
  Green, P. J. and Mortera, J. (2021) <doi:10.1111/rssc.12498>.
